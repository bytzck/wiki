# Important Changes to BYTZ 2.0

Upgrading BYTZ 2.0 requires a _**FULL RESYNC**_ of the blockchain. 

This version also updates and changes the location of user specific files including wallet.dat.  

_It is imperative that you back up your wallet.dat and private keys BEFORE upgrading to BYTZ 2.0_

** New Default datadir for BYTZ**

`Linux: ~/.bytzcoin/   `  
`Windows: %APPDATA%\bytzcoin  `  
`Mac OS: ~/Library/Application Support/bytzcoin/ `
